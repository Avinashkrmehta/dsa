### Tree Terminology

A tree is a collection of nodes where:

- Each node contains data.
- Nodes are connected by edges.
- One node is designated as the root.
- Every node (except the root) has exactly one parent.
- Nodes can have multiple children.

#### Key Terms

- **Root Node**: The topmost node in a tree.
- **Parent & Child**: A node is a parent if it has children; the nodes connected below it are its children.
- **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent.
- **Descendants**: All nodes that exist below a given node.
- **Ancestors**: All nodes along the path from a node to the root.
- **Degree of a Node**: The number of children a node has.
- **Degree of a Tree**: The maximum degree of any node in the tree.
- **Leaf Node (External Node)**: A node with no children.
- **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child.
- **Level of a Node**: The depth at which a node exists, starting from the root at level 1.
- **Height of a Tree**: The longest path from the root to a leaf, measured in edges.
- **Forest**: A collection of disjoint trees.

### Binary Trees

A binary tree is a special type of tree where:

- Each node has at most two children.
- Children are classified as left child and right child.
- A node can have 0, 1, or 2 children.

#### Properties of Binary Trees

- Every node has at most two children.
- A binary tree can be empty.
- Each node can have left and right subtrees.

#### Examples of Binary Trees

A tree where every node has at most two children is a binary tree. Nodes can be labeled as left child and right child. Some special types of binary trees include:

- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
